# Rabin-Karp-Demo

## How to Use
Included in this test program, there is a text file called "book.txt". In order for this program to run, you will want to put this file (or any other external files you would like to run the program with) in your cmake-build-debug folder. 

This program takes two arguments. Both these arguments have to do with the book.txt file (or any other text file you choose to use for testing). 
1. First argument: the pattern you are searching for within the text file.
2. Second argument: the name of the text file you are using for testing.

As an example, if you were to want to search for the pattern "Dursley" in the text file "book.txt", you might run your program on the command line like so:
./Rabin_Karp_Demo Dursley book.txt
